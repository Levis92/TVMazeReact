# TV Maze React (Next.js)

## Requirements
Install the latest LTS version (or later) of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Installation
Clone with SSH
```
git clone git@github.com:Levis92/TVMazeReact.git
cd TVMazeReact/tv-maze
```

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Running the application
Run in development mode
```
npm run dev
```

Build and run production server
```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Running tests
Testing is done with Cypress. To start Cypress:
```
npm run cypress
```

## Time constraints regarding the assignment
I limited the amount of time of this to one day. Spent a good amount of time on making small improvements to the code in general, testing tools, loading feedback etc. Given more time I would fetch and display more data, added pages for e.g. episodes, use an i18n library, more theming settings and dark mode support.
